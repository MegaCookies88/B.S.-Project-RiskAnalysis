# Introduction to risk analysis and quantitative finance
This repository contains my work for my bachelor thesis at EPFL. It was my first deep interest in the financial world.\
It contains the paper I wrote and my code for generating the figures in the report.\
The paper contains 3 main chapters :
- Portfolio optimization
- Risk analysis
- Option pricing

I believe this repository can be useful to anyone starting in quantitative analysis and time series.
